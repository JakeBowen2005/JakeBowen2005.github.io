### CPSC 120

* Lab 5
        Lab 5, Part 2 was one of my favorite labs as we started to finally implement functions into programs. For this specific lab, we prompted the user to enter a number of feet, and then our program would convert their number into a number of inches. We also had to ensure the user would not prompt a number too large or too small, so we had to use the std::number_limits functions. This lab was one of the first where we really had to understand how functions work and how their arguments can be used to help us.

* Lab 7
        Lab 7, part 1, was all about letting the user enter command-line arguments in order to figure out the number of days between two different dates. This lab really taught us how to use command-line arguments in our favor. We also had to convert each command-line argument into an integer in order for the functions to work together. I liked this lab because taking in the command-line arguments was very fun compared to using the std::cin command.

* Lab 9
        Lab 9, part 1, only had one file, which did make it a little easier because we did not have to define or write functions in any other files. But this program calculated the averages of scores, the way the Olmypics do it. Here we first started to use vectors, and we had to loop through the vectors with range-based loops and regular loops. This helped me understand how important these for loops can be. I liked this lab because it illustrated to me the importance of both types of for loops and how to implement them.
